Quote: "Brotherhood isn't always about blood; it's about someone who's got your back when the world gets heavy."
Food I dont like: I dont like to eat only grass in a food. 
Recommendation: I recommend you to learn ski if you havent already, it is so much fun. The interesting part is that you fall many times but you learn to get up. 
German Word I learned: Use Guten Morgan to greet people in the morning.
